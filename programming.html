                <li>Kinds of tests:</li> 
                <li>Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.</li> 
                <li>Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.</li>
                <li>Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application</li>
                <li>Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black- box testing is a common way to verify functions.</li>
                <li>Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evalute performance under real-life conditions.</li>
                <li>Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.</li>
                <li>Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.</li>
                <li>Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use system or web application to complete a task.</li>
            </ul>    
               
                <li>Software testing is done to detect:</li>
             <ol>
                <li>Architectural flaws</li>
                <li>Poor design decisions</li>
                <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
                <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Scalability issues</li>
            </ol>
            
                <li>Testing best pratices:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Continous testing: Project teams test each build as it becomes available. This software relies on test automation that integrated with the deployment process.</li>
                <li>Configuration management: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds code, the requirements, and design documents.</li>
                <li>Servic virtualization: Testing environments may not be available, especially early in code development. Service virtualization simulates the services and systems that are missing.</li>
                <li>Defect or "bug tracking: Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality.</li>
                <li>Metric and reporting: Reproting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results.</li>
