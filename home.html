                    <h2>What does the Vice President do?</h2>
                    <p>Vice presidents are elected by the senate and are named after their position in the constitution. 
                        During the election and the counting of electoral ballots, the vice president settles unfair votes, including ties in votes, while overseeing the counting.</p>
                    <h3>Information on the Vice President and Important people</h3>
                    <p>The vice president is under the president, and the vice president is held in office, but under the president. 
                        For example, George Clinton and John C. Calhoun were examples of vice presidents held in office under two different presidents. 
                        Some more interesting vice presidents that most people have heard of are Thomas Jefferson, George Clinton, and John Adams.
                        
                        
                      <ol>
                        <li>Firstly, John Adams was under the presidency of George Washington dated between the years of 1789-1797 and consulted with the Federalist party. </li>
                        <li>The second important person on the list of vice presidents is Thomas Jefferson held under the presidency of John Adams and dated between the years of 1797-1801, was under the party of Republican. </li>
                        <li>Finally, George Clinton was under the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, and this date in the years 1805-1809, while under the party of Republican.</li> 
                    </ol>  
                        Now as you can tell by the cycle of this and the examples I used, most vice presidents hold office, while under a party. 
                        This cycle of the presidency continues in these years, but the real question is how vice presidents can become vice presidents and what kind of experience they need, despite being given the title of vice president. 
                        Unlike becoming the president, which would make sense for a vice president to become a president. 
                        The vice president already gains most experience from being under the president and the senate while that’s enough experience to become a president from a vice president's viewpoint. 
                        Back to the real question about vice presidency experience and if you’re wondering how these important people gain the knowledge to be named vice president by the constitution, well most vice presidents had some experience with the Congress and State Governors, including experience in public services. 
                        After learning about some important people and experience dealing with the vice president.

                    <h4>Infomation on the Vice President office and facts</h4>
                    
                    
                        <p>Where might the Vice president's office be located?</p>
                
                         <ul> 
                             <li>The vice president's office and residence are located on the White House property.</li>
                            <li>One of the houses built on the white house property is the White 19th century house, which was located in Northwestern Washington, D.C., and built in the year 1893.</li>
                            <li>The real purpose of this house was for the USNO superintendent, but sadly by the year 1923, the superintendent was kicked out by a naval Chief of operations.<li>
                            <li>That being said this house belongs to the vice presidents including the families of the vice president.</li>
                            <li>So, some of the vice presidents that have lived or used the house are Gerald Ford, Nelson Rockefeller, and Walter Mondale, the surprising part is that most of the vice presidents only used them for their desires instead of actually moving in like Walter Mondale.</li>
                            <li>He was actually the first to move in. The vice presidents also allowed multiple people to visit their residences and home.<li>
                            <li>Therefore, we know the houses of the vice presidents are located on the White House property.</li>
                            <li>But what about the vice president's office? Yes, we know that the office must be located on the White house premise.</li>
                            <li>To be direct, it's located in the West Wing and is used for the vice president meeting and important press interviews.</li>
                            <li>Another interesting fact about the vice president is that the desk in the vice president's room is a collection that was once used by Theodore Roosevelt in the year 1902.<li>
                            <li>In spite of the desk, the vice president's room contains more items similar to the desk than just that one. The real significance of this desk is that it was signed by the previous users ever since the year of 1940s.<li>
                        </ul>
